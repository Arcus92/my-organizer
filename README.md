# MyOrganizer

Small unfinished project to learn the Avalonia UI framework. **This is not usable in the current state!**

## Goals / Ideas

I always wanted to create a free, open-source, cross-platform organizer application for notes and passwords. 
It should support synchronisation for multiple devices and from many - even self-hosted - services.

The organizer should support multiple data vaults. A vault *can* be encrypted. Each vault has it's own password.
The user can either unlock every vault manually, or store the other passwords in a main vault and let the app use these 
to auto-encrypt the other vaults.

The app should be as modular as possible, so you could create plugins for e.g. recipes or even other media.
